# Cross-File Patterns

Find patterns, themes, and connections across files related to a topic.

## Usage
`/patterns [search term or topic]`

## Instructions

1. **Search broadly** - Use mcp-obsidian tools to find files matching the topic:
   - `obsidian_simple_search` for text matches
   - Check `02 Inbox/`, `03 Projects/`, `04 Areas/`, `05 Resources/` for relevant content

2. **Read matches** - For each matching file, read and extract:
   - Key claims or ideas
   - Sources cited
   - Dates (for recency)
   - Any contradictions with other files

3. **Synthesize patterns** - Look for:
   - Recurring themes across sources
   - Evolution of thinking over time
   - Contradictions or tensions
   - Gaps in coverage
   - Connections the user might not have noticed

4. **Output format**:
```markdown
## Patterns: [topic]

### Recurring Themes
- [theme 1]: found in [file1], [file2]
- [theme 2]: found in [file3]

### Evolution
- [Earlier thinking] → [Current thinking]

### Contradictions/Tensions
- [Source A] says X, but [Source B] says Y

### Connections
- [Unexpected link between ideas]

### Gaps
- [What's missing from the collected material]
```

5. **Be concise** - This is for quick pattern recognition, not comprehensive summaries. Aim for actionable insights.
