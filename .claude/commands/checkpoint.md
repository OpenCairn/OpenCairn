# Checkpoint

**This command is `/park --compact`.**

Run the full `/park` workflow with `--compact` implied — quality gate, WIP update, bidirectional links, reference graph tracing, stranded work product check, tickler, then `/compact` to reclaim context window. Session continues after.

Closing message: "Progress saved. Session continues." (not "Parked. Pick up when ready.")

**Proceed with the full `/park --compact` workflow now.**
